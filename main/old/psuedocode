// Input handlers:

web interface with four buttons:
*up* *down* *gone*, sets setback mode, [with a setback values stored in a file] and *coming home*, sets occupied mode [with occupied values stored in a file]

physical interfaces:
push-button for "warmup once now" - needs backend change to implement.  Will need to think on this
push-button to activate occupied mode
dual-pole switch with center-off - one way sets to 'occupied' and overrides other inputs (except maybe web with over-override password?), other way sets to 'vacant' (setback)

occupancy sensors?

time-based set-back.

time-based occupied?  I probably wouldn't use this but it wouldn't be hard to implement it.
